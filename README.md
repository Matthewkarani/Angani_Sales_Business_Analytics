Highlighting best and worst-selling products.
Understanding customer profiles and preferences.
Detecting seasonal or trend-based patterns in sales.
Objectives
Design a Power BI dashboard that provides interactive, high-impact visuals of key performance indicators (KPIs).
Deliver insights on sales trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.
